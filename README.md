# DownloadWallBypasser
Bypass download walls on popular sound sharing sites.

## Supported sites
+ The Artist Union
+ Hypeddit

Once you are on one of these sites an ugly download button is shown. Just click it to download the track. No need to follow and comment!

## Installation
+ Install a userscript manager (e.g. Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey)
+ Install this script in the userscript manager


*The reason I made this userscript is that I do not want to be forced to follow a bunch of unrelated accounts and to comment. I also do not like the idea that these sites have access to my account. If I like an artists work I will support him anyway!*

*Feel free to improve this script!*
