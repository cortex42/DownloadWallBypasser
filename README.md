# HypedditBypasser
A little user script for your browser that lets you directly (without logging in) download a track from Hypeddit. You need a user script manager to use it (e.g. Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey).

Once you are on a site that begins with "http://hypeddit.com/track/sc/" the script immediately starts the download of the track.
